# 📝 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📌 Project Description  
The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a data analysis project designed to track and visualize global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases), the project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual storytelling with Python data tools. The goal is to produce a professional-level report or interactive notebook with insights suitable for presentation or publication.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
- ✅ Analyze time-based trends: total cases, deaths, and vaccinations  
- ✅ Compare COVID-19 metrics across countries and regions  
- ✅ Visualize patterns using graphs, charts, and maps  
- ✅ Communicate findings using visualizations and narrative in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code** (with Jupyter extension)  
- **pandas** – Data loading and manipulation  
- **matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **seaborn** – Enhanced visualizations  
- **plotly express** (optional) – Interactive charts & choropleth maps  
- **geopandas** (optional) – Advanced geographic mapping  

## 🚀 How to Run/View the Project  

### 📥 Setup Instructions  
1. Clone this repository:  
---
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Denis-Mwanzia/python-week-8-assignment.git 
   cd python-week-8-assignment  
```
---

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
---
```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
```
---

3. Install required libraries:  
---
```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas jupyter  
```
---

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
---
```bash
   jupyter notebook  
```
---
   Open the `python-week-8-assignment` file in your browser.  

### 📄 Alternatively  
- Export the notebook as a **PDF** or **HTML** report for easy sharing.  
- Screenshots and visuals can be used to build a **PowerPoint** presentation.

## 🔍 Insights & Reflections  
- 🌍 **Vaccination disparities**: Developed countries had a significantly faster vaccine rollout compared to developing regions.  
- 📈 **Wave patterns**: Multiple countries experienced clear COVID-19 waves that aligned with global spikes.  
- ❗ **Data gaps**: Inconsistent reporting in some countries created challenges in drawing accurate comparisons.  
- 🧪 **Death rate**: Countries with early lockdowns and stronger healthcare systems generally had lower case fatality rates.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive visualizations** using Plotly made it easier to understand vaccination coverage globally.
